<p> We’ve made it to the end of your app development! We’re super excited to get {{$dataList['business_name']}} sent over to the App Stores. We are now looking at getting you transferred on to a maintenance plan detailed below;</p>

<p>Our 12-month plan includes:</p>
<ul>

<li> Full Server Provided* </li>  
<li> App stores upgrades/bugs </li>  
<li> Dedicated project manager </li>  
<li> Continued support </li>   
</ul>
