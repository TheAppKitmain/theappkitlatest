Hey <b>{{$dataList['first_name']}}</b>,<br><br>

We are excited to get started on your Mobile App. Firstly i'll need these points below off the list at this early stage.<br><br>

<b>Our Mobile App / Website</b><br><br>

Please download our Mobile App as this will be a quicker way for you to check all pending tasks, submit bugs and message our team directly through the App.<br><br>

Note - Your login details are the same as the one registered on our website.<br><br>

<b>Registering with Apple & Andriod App stores</b><br><br>

Both Apps stores require you to have a business account in order to go live. Please click the links below and follow the steps:<br><br>

<b>Gmail Account</b><br><br>

We use Gmail to send push notifications inside your App. Please can we have a gmail account which we can log into. <br><br>Feel free to create a new account as this will solely be for backend notifications. We require the Email & Password<br><br>

<b>MY UDID</b><br><br>

In order to send you over a test build, we require your UDID (and any other colleagues who have an iPhone).<br><br> 
Your UDID number is a unique number on each iPhone which allows us to send you the test App without having to upload it to the App store.<br><br>

Please click the link below and follow the instructions:<br><br>

<b>Note</b> - If you have other friends or colleagues whom you would like to check the App, please send them the link. Android users do not require a UDID.<br><br>

<b>Logo and Colour Scheme</b><br><br>

Please send a High Res logo back via email. Our designers will get started on the App today.<br><br>

<b>Sign up Fields</b><br><br>

It would be great to get a head start on the sign-up fields for your App. Think about what each user type (if multiple) would need to sign up.<br><br> 

As standard, every App will require an Email & Password.<br><br> 

<b>Example of fields you can use:</b><br><br>

Full Name<br>
Email<br>
Password<br>
Business Name<br>
Submit ID<br>
Number<br>
DOB<br>
Address<br>

If you want to ask the user any questions with the sign up process, please list them also<br><br>

All steps above are vital to having a succsesful App in the store. If you have any questions, i'll be happy to help.<br><br>

Thanks,<br>
The App Kit Team<br>
